Plans for my Harry Potter Network:

The BIG picture:
     start with smaller networks (less hard-coded data) and focus on the change of relationship between pair of characters 
     -- how such relationships envolve along with the development of the story

For draft(presentation) I will only create graph before entering the wizarding world. Thus, most the the characters do not show the "HOUSE" property -- gold for witches and wizards, silver for muggles, bronze for Higrid/elfs/fantastic beasts.


Every character is a node containg such info:

=======ORDER======== [now]
the oder of appearance (start from 0, treated as each character's unique ID), which is equal to the index of the character in the json.characters "list" 
====================

========NAME======== [now]
just the name (first + last is enough, don't want to deal with extra long middle names lol)
====================

=======IMAGE======== [now]
the address of the image relative to the index.html in the root file
====================

========TYPE======== [now] ==> assign different filling color to this factor
M/G/H/R/S/F/O/U
Muggle: M
Gryffindor: G
Hufflepuff: H
Ravenclaw: R
Slytherin: S
Foreign magicians: F
Other magical creatures (beasts, elves, goasts, figures in pictures): O
Unkown or unclear: U
====================

=======FACTION====== [later] ==> assign different boarder color to this factor
P/A/M/E/N/G
Order of the Phoenix: P
D.A.: A
The Ministry of Magic: M
Death Eaters: E
Neutral: N
"For the Greater Good" (and Deathly Hallows): G (wait...Then everything in Fantastic Beasts also???)
====================

====FIRST-APPEAR====[later]
[x,y] x for book, y for chapters
====================

========WORDS========[now]
One/Two-sentence(s) the character says
====================


Color choices:

===>Color of graph edges: 

Relationship                      Color                   Graph Weight
for sure to include:
Real Enemy                        rgb(241, 65, 65)        1
Resisting                         rgb(255, 141, 10)       2
Neutral                           rgb(241, 220, 65)       3
Friend                            rgb(179, 241, 65)       4
Best Friend／family／advocator     rgb(17, 200, 21)        5



maybe later I should distinguish those from the above:  (no need for the first book though lol)
Lovers                            rgb(204, 36, 255)       ???
Servant                           rgb(0, 255, 221)        ???


===>Filling Color for TYPE
Muggle: M
Gryffindor: G
Hufflepuff: H
Ravenclaw: R
Slytherin: S
Foreign magicians: F
Other magical creatures (fantastic beasts, elves, goasts, figures in pictures):O
Unkown or not clear: U

===>Boarder Color for FACTION
Order of the Phoenix: P
